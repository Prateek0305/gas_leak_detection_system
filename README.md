🚨 Gas Leak Detection System


📌 Overview:

The Gas Leak Detection System is designed to detect the presence of hazardous gases (e.g., LPG, Methane, Propane) in the environment and trigger alerts to prevent accidents.
The system continuously monitors gas concentration and provides real-time alerts through a buzzer, LED indicators, and/or IoT notifications.


✨ Features

Real-time gas concentration monitoring

Automatic alerts via buzzer and LED

Optional IoT connectivity for remote alerts (SMS/email/app notification)

Low-cost and power-efficient design

User-friendly and portable

🛠️ Components Used

MQ-2/MQ-5 Gas Sensor – detects LPG, Methane, Propane

Arduino Uno / ESP8266 / ESP32 – microcontroller for processing

Buzzer & LED – local alert system

Power supply – 5V or USB

(Optional) Wi-Fi Module – for IoT-based notifications

(Optional) LCD Display – for showing real-time gas concentration

⚙️ How It Works

The MQ-series gas sensor detects the concentration of gases in the surrounding air.

The microcontroller continuously reads sensor data and compares it to a predefined threshold.

If the gas concentration exceeds the threshold:

Buzzer sounds an alarm

LED flashes

(If IoT-enabled) a remote alert is sent to the user via the internet

The system keeps monitoring and alerts until the environment is safe.
